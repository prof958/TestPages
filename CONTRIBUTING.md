## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

1. **Write clean, readable code**
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Avoid deep nesting

2. **Comment thoughtfully**
   - Explain "why", not "what"
   - Document complex logic
   - Keep comments up-to-date

3. **Follow existing patterns**
   - Match the style of existing code
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Maintain project structure

### HTML Standards

```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML5 elements -->
<header>
  <nav>
    <!-- Navigation -->
  </nav>
</header>

<!-- Use proper indentation (2 spaces) -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Description text here.</p>
</section>

<!-- Always include alt text for images -->
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Descriptive text">

<!-- Use lowercase for tags and attributes -->
<div class="container">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</div>
```

### CSS Standards

```css
/* Use meaningful class names (BEM methodology recommended) */
.block__element--modifier {
  /* Properties in alphabetical order */
  color: #333;
  display: flex;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Use consistent spacing */
.selector-1,
.selector-2 {
  property: value;
}

/* Organize by sections */
/* ========================================
   Component Name
   ======================================== */

/* Mobile-first approach */
.element {
  /* Mobile styles */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    /* Tablet styles */
  }
}
```

### JavaScript Standards

```javascript
// Use modern ES6+ syntax
const functionName = (param) => {
  // Function body
};

// Use meaningful variable names
const userProfile = getUserProfile();

// Use const by default, let when reassignment needed
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com';
let counter = 0;

// Add JSDoc comments for functions
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers
 * @param {number} a - First number
 * @param {number} b - Second number
 * @returns {number} Sum of a and b
 */
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Handle errors appropriately
try {
  // Code that might throw
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error message:', error);
}
```

### Guidelines

- Keep subject line under 50 characters
